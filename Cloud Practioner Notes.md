# <u>Cloud Foundations</u>
##### As A Service
* **IaaS** - Managed Physical Hardware and Hypervisor (software that runs the OS).  etc EC2
* **PaaS** - Managed Physical Hardware, Hypervisor, and  OS/Runtime.  etc Elastic Beanstalk
* **SaaS** - Everything is managed by the provider, only consuming software

##### Cloud Deployment Models
* Private Cloud - dedicated infrastructure and data center.  Ex.) VMware, Microsoft, Redhat, OpenStack
* Public Cloud - Hosted and delivered from a 3rd-party (typically over the internet).  Ex.) AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform
    * Variable expense, instead of capital expense
    * Economies of scale - savings on large scale projects
    * Massive elasticity - grow to any size
* Hybrid Cloud - A mix of public and private clouds
  * Keeps critical sensitive applications/data in house while non-critical applications/data can be put in the public cloud
* Multicloud - Two or more clouds 

##### Legacy IT
* Large upfront cost for infrastrucure
* Operations within the organization is an big expensive
* Operations costs don't go down as the company scales down

## Three Fundamentals of AWS Pricing
* Compute - pay for virtual server + CPU cycles
* Storage - pay for the amount of data you have stored
* Outbound data - pay for the amount of data you pull out (charged at the outbound data transfer rate)

* On-demand
  * Used for Compute and Database capacity
  * No long-term commitments or upfront payments
* Dedicated Instances
  * Available for Amazon Ec2
  * Hardware is dedicated to a single customer
* Spot instances
  * Purchase spare capacity with no commitments
  * **Great discounts for hourly rates**
* Reservations
  * Up to 75% discounts (with 1 or 3 year term), No/Partial/All upfront cost options
  * Availabe for these services: EC2, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, RDS, RedShift

```code
AWS Acceptable User Policy - study it.
```


## <u>IAM</u>
**Authentication**
* Access key and Secret key combined provide programatic Access (CLI, SDK, etc)
  * MFA can be added on
  * These keys can be rotated, but the secret key is only available at the time of creation
  * Users CAN change their own keys **through IAM policy (not from the console)**
  * These keys can be disabled at any time by administrative means
* Tradiational sign in with user/pass in AWS Console
  * MFA can be added on.
  * Users can change their own passwords
  * The ability to give only selected users password changing abilities exists.  
    * First disable the password changing ability for all users via an IAM Policy.
    * Then grant the password changing ability to the selected users you wish to have it.
* Signing Certificate (not very often)
  * SSL/TLS certificate that can be used to authenticate with some AWS services.
  * AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is recommended for provisioning, managing and deploying your server certificates
  * Use IAM when you must support HTTPS connections in a region that is not supported by ACM (less and less common)
  * 
**MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** - A combination of something you know (password, secret), have (phone, usb), or ARE (biometrics)

### Best Practices
* Lock away the AWS root user access keys
* Create individual IAM users, do not share amongst multiple persons
* Use AWS defined policies to assign permissions whenever possible
* User groups to assign permissions to IAM users, will help relieve the clutter of user -> policy assignments
* Least Privilege approach
* User access level to **review** IAM permissions
* Configure strong password policy for users
* Enable MFA for **ALL privileged** users
* **Use roles for applications that run on AWS EC2 instances**
  * Never put User/Pass/Keys into code [on EC2 instances]
* Use Roles over sharing credentials
* Rotate credentials regularly (this is hard to do in practice)
* Remove unnecessary credentials
* Use policy conditions for extra security (ex. certain computer coming from certain ip address)
* Monitor activity in your AWS account (tools to use later in the course)

## <u>STS (Security Token Service)</u>
* Allows for the abilit to request temporary, limit-privilege credentials for IAM users or for users that you authenticate (federated users)
* Global service https://sts.amazonaws.com
* All regions are eabled by default, but can be disabled
* The region in which temporary credentials are requested muist be enabled
* Credentials will **always work globally**

# AWS Compute

## <u>EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</u>
Web Service providing secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud

* IaaS (Infrastructure)
* Composed of CPU, RAM, Disk, NIC and OS (**Linux**/Windows/etc)
* Instance - Individual Virtual Server
  * AMI (Amazon Machine Image) - an **EBS (Elastic Blockstore Volume) Snapshot** (which has an OS installed on it)
  * Type - scale of resources (small, medium, large, xlarge, etc)
* Elasticity - increase or decrease capacity within minutes, commission 1-1000+ instacnes simultaneously
* Complete control (including root access) to each instance
  * No loss of data on start/stop
  * Ability to communicate to via API
* Flexible Hosting Services - preconfigued images based on configurable options (OS, hardware, storage, etc)
* Scale Vertically (CPU/Mem/HDD)
* Scale Horizontally (automatically) with Auto Scaling
* Used for Traditional Applications that from for long periods of time (month/years)
* Pay for instance run time based on family/type (resources allocated)
  
Instance data - Configuration data about your instances can be found and queried at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
User data - 16kb max of non-encrpyted user supplied data, commands run when the instances launchs

## <u>AMI (Amazon Machine Image)</u>
Provides the information required to launch an instance
* One or more EBS snapshots (a copy of an EBS volume)
* Permission settings associated with the launching the AMI
* A device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when launched
  
Type:
* Community AMIs - free to use, typically just select the OS you want
* Marketplace AMIs - pay to use, usually somes with additional licensed software
* My AMIs - AMIs that you create yourself

[Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)


## <u>ECS (Elastic Container Service)</u>
* CaaS (Container)
* Provides a **highly scalable, high performance container management service** that **supports Docker container**
* Container - a virtual instance, OS is not apart of it
  * Contains Code, runtime, system tools/libraryies/settings
* Eliminates the need for own implementation of cluster management
* There are 2 launch types:
  |EC2|Fargate|
  |---|---|
  |Explicitly Provisioned Instances|(Control plane) **Resources are automatically provisioned**|
  |Responsible for upgrading and patching|Provisions compute as needed|
  |**Manually** handle cluster optimization|**Automatically** handles cluster   optimization|
  |**More granular control over infreatructure**|**Limited control, as infrastructure is automated**|
  |Best for microservice and batch use cases where you need containers and have the need to maintain the underlying platform|Same, but best is there is no need for maintaining an underlying platform|
  |Pay for instance run time based on family/type|Pay for container run time based on allocated resources|

## <u>Lambda</u>
* FaaS (Function)
* Serverless, allowing you to run code without provisioning or managing servers
* Typically executed off of a trigger.  Ex. API call, scheduled run, another lambda?, etc
* Pay only for compute time, this is the big payoff of serverless
* Benefits of Lambda:
  * No servers to manage
  * Continuous scaling
  * Subsecond metering
  * Integrates with almost all other AWS services
* Primary user cases:
  * Data processing
  * Real-time file/stream processing
  * Building a serverless backend for web, mobile, IOT, and 3rd party API requests
* Auto Scaling up to 1000 (default limit) concurrent executions
* Best use cases - ETL, infrastructure automation, data validation, mobile backends
* Pay only for execution time based on memory allocation

## <u> LightSail </u>
* Best for users who do not have deep AWS technical expertise
* Makes it very easy to provision computer services
* Basically it bundles compute into simple use-cases for a 'low barrier to entry'


# AWS Storage

### Storage System types
* Object Storage (S3)
  * Manage data as individual objcts, rather than as blocks and sectors (block-based) or a file hierarchy (file-based)
  * Accessed via REST API (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc)
  * Each object contains the data itself, metadata, and a **globally unique identifier** (this is a constraint of S3)
  * Virtually unlimited scalability to due flat file structure
* Block Storage (EBS - Elastic Block Storage)
  * Manage data in blocks within sectors and tracks and is controller by a server-based operating system
  * Appears as local disks to the OS and can be partitioned and formatted
  * **You can use block storage devices as a boot volume**
  * Use Cases - Structured information such as a file system, databases, transactional logs, SQL databases and virtual machines (VMs)
  * EC2 attached to EBS which has the OS that it runs and it's connected over a network
* File Storage
  * Manage data in file structures (hierarchy)
  * Mounted via the network to a client computer where it then becomes accessible for reading and writing data
  * Protocols used for accessing file systems include NFS or (Microsoft) CIFS/SMB


# <u>S3 (Simple Storage Service)</u>
* Object storage system built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere
* Public service - everyone connects to it over the public internet
  * Edge case - S3 Gateway Endpoint can allow for an EC2 instance to connect to S3 without going to through Public Internet 
* Any type of file supported
* S3 is designed to deliver 99.99999999999 (11) durability
* Use Cases
  * Backup and Storage
  * Application Hosting - deploy, install, and manage web applications
  * Media Hosting - upload/download style service of any type of media
  * Software Delivery - customer download portal for your applications
  * Static Website - run static page straight from an S3 bucket!
* Buckets are root level folders
* Files are stored in buckets with a 5TB limit per file
* Unlimited storage - charged for storage
* **S3 is a universal namespace** so bucket names must be unique globally
* However, you **create your buckets within a REGION**
* It is a best practice to create buckets in regions that are physically closest to your user's to reduce latency
* Objects consist of:
  * Key - name of the object
  * Value - data made up of a sequence of bytes)
  * Version ID - changes on each upload?
  * Metadata - information relating to the data that is stored
* Pricing:
  * Storage - pay for what you put in
  * Requests - Retrieve data
  * Storage Management
  * Data transfer
  * Transfer acceleration - way to accelerate the upload of data to S3

Storage Class
* **Standard** - durable, immediately available, **frequency accessed**
* **Intelligent-Tiering** - automatically moves data to the most cost-effective tier
* **Standard-IA** - durable, immediately available, **infrequency accessed**
* **One Zone-IA** - lower cost for infrequently accessed data with LESS resilience (99.5%, due to non-replicated data accross multiple availability zones)
* **Glacier** - archieve data, retrieval times in minutes or hours
* **Glacier Deep Archive** - lowest cost storage class for long term retention

|S3 Capability|How it works|
|---|---|
|Transfer Acceleration| Speed up data uploads using CloudFront in reverse|
|Requester Pays|The requester rather than the bucket owner pays for requests and data transfer|
|Tags|Assign taghs to objects to use in costing, billing, security, etc|
|Events|Trigger notifications to SNS, SQS, or Lanbda when certain events happen in your bucket|
|Static Web Hosting|Simple and massively scalable static website hosting|
|BitTorrent|Use the BitTorrent protocol to retrieve any publicly available object by automatically generating a .torrent file|

Versioning - sounds like what it is, if Versioning is suspended, it prevents NEW VERSIONS from being uploaded, all uploads will be under the latest version.  Deleting the object creates a new version.

CRR - Cross-Region Replication
  * Source and destinations must have versioning enabled
  * Can be the same or different account
SRR - Same-Region Replications
  * same as CRR, just in the same region

Why replication?
  * Compliance requirements
  * Backups into another region
  * Copy to another region for closer access for users
  * Copy into a new storage tier


# <u>EBS (Elastic Block Store)</u>
* Provides persistence block storage, even if associated (EC2) instance is detacted and terminated
* Replicated within its AZ
* No need for an EBS to be attached an instance, can be zombied with no problem
* 1:M -> EC2 Instance:EBS Volumes
* * Multiple EBS volumes can be attached to the same instance
  * Can not attach EBS volum to multiple instances (use EFlastic File Store instead)
* EBS is AZ contrained, meaning the instance has to be in the same AZ
* **Termination protection is OFF by default** and must be manually enabled (keeps the volume/data when teh instance is terminated)
  * Root EBS volumes are deleted on termination by default
  * Extra non-boot volumes are not deleted on termination by default
* **SSD is the default boot type for EC2 instances**

### EBS Volume Info:
|Type|Description|Use Cases|Size|MAX IOPS/ Volume|Max Throughout/ Volume|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)|**Highest Performance** designed for latency-sensitive transactional workloads|I/O-Intensive NoSQL and relational databases|4GB-16TB|64,000|1,000MB/s|
|EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2)|General Purpose, balances price performance for a wide variety of transactional worklaods|Boot volumes, low-latency, interactive apps, dev & test|1GB-16TB|16,000|250MB/s|
|Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)|Low cost, designed for frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads|Big data, data warehouses, log processing|500GB-16TB|500|500MB/s|
|Cold HDD (sc1)|**Lowest Cost** designed for less frequently accessed workloads|Colder data requiring fewer scans per day|500GB-16TB|250|250MB/s

### EBS Snapshot
* Point-In-Time state backup of EBS Volume
* Stored as object in S3
* **Each new snapshot is a delta (incremental) of the previous**
  * Only the latest is needed to restore the volume, which is CRAZY COOL!
* Snapshots can only be access through the EC2 APIs
* EBS volumes are AZ specific, but snapshots are region specific
  * An EBS Snapshot is a way to migrate your EBS Volume to another AZ in the created region.  The flow for that is Existing Volume -> Snapshot (S3) -> Create AMI from Snapshot -> Launch new EC2 Instance pointing to new AMI

### Instance Store Volume
* Physically attached to the Server the EC2 instance is running on
* When the EC2 instance is shutdown/terminated, the Instance Store Volume is not persisted (Ephemeral)
* High Performance local disks
* Good for temp dat - buffer, cache, sratch data, etc.
* ISV root devices are created from AMI templates stored on S3
* ISV cannot be detached/reattached

# <u>EFS (Elastic File System)</u>
* **Network based**, scalable file storage system, mounted as a file system
* NFS Format - Network File System Format (v4.1 protocol)
* **Multiple EC2 Instances can connect to the same File System**
* On-prem solution compliant
* **Linux ONLY**
* Use Cases
  * Big Data and Analytics
  * Media processing Workflows
  * Content Management
  * Web Serving
  * Home Directories
* **Data is stored across multiple AZ's within a region**
* Read after write consistency (Opposite of Eventual Consistency)
* Pay for what you user
* On-premises access can be enabled via Direct Connect or AWS VPN
* After a EFS is attached to an instance, the EFS needs to be mounted via CLI (or attached through console at creation, maybe can be updated in console as well)

# <u>Storage Gateway</u>
* Hybrid cloud storage service that gives you **on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage**
* Seamlessly connects on-premises applications to cloud storage, **caching data locally for low-latency access**
* Types of Gateway:
  * Tape - virtual tape library
  * File Gateway - accessed using SMB (Microsoft), NFS or S3 API protocols
  * Volume Gateway - block device access using iSCSI (look into)


# AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
A VPC is a logically isolated (your AWS account only) portion of the AWS cloud within a region.
* A VPC spans all the AZs in the region and exist by default (Subnets as well)
  * 5 per region max
* A VPC has a different address block called a **different CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing) block**, a list of addresses that VPC can use
* A Subnet is a subset of those VPC addresses
  * Has a block of IP addresses from the VPC CIDR block
  * Subnets are created within AZs
  * Each 
* All traffic in and out of the VPC goes through the Internet Gateway, which uses a Router (that references the 'Main Route Table')
* A VPC provides complete control over the virtual networking environment including selection of IP ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and gateways
* When you create a VPC, you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the form of a CIDR block, for examples 10.0.0.0/16
 * You have full control over who has access to the AWS resources inside your VPC

How to securely connect?
* AWS Managed VPN - fast to setup
  * Encrypted VPN connection between external customer gateway to owned VPN gateway
  * Not guaranteed on performance
* AWS Direct Connect - high bandwidth, low-latency but takes weeks to months to setup
  * On-prem and Cloud connection, typically creates a hybrid cloud
  * Network service that provides an alternative to useing the internet to connect a customer's on premise sites to AWS
  * The connection is private
  * Charged by port hours and data transfer, Available in 1Gbps and 10Gbps or through AWS Direct Connect Partners
  * Guaranteed performance
* VPN Cloud Hub - used for connection multile sites to AWS
* Software VPN - use  3rd party software
  
## ACL (Access Control Lists)
* Subnet level firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic
* Allow and deny rule (White and Black lists)
* Stateless, checks rules sequencially until all pass or single fail 
  
## Security Group
* Instance level firewall that controls inbound and outbound internet traffic permissions on a GROUP of resources
* Can be used in multiple subnets, because it's just traffic rules
* Allow rules only (White list)
* Stateful, checkes all rules on each request

## NAT Gateway  (Network Address Translation)
* Translations public ips to private ips
* VPC associated
* Used by uUpdating route table so that private subnet route table goes to NAT Gateway id
* Managed by AWS

## Nat Instance
* EC2 Instance from a specific AMI
* Same functionality of a NAT Gateway
* Managed by you
* Can use as a bastion host, a way to get to the private subnet via this ec2 instance.  Typically for 'management/devops reasons'

## Transit Gateway
* Connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub
* Simplifies networks and puts an end to complex peering relationships
  * Peering relationships are not transitive between VPCs
* Acts as a CLOUD ROUTER
* Inter-Region peering connects AWS Transit Gateways together using the AWS global network (AWS's private internet)
* Data is automatically encrypted and never tranels over a public network

# AWS Databases

|Data Store|Use Case|
|---|---|
|Database on ECS| Need full control over instance and database <br> Third-party database engine (not available in RDS)|

# AWS Cloud Security and Identity 

## The Shared Responsibility Model
* Defines what AWS and you (the consumer of AWS services) are responsible for.  It's a shared responsibility between AWs and the Customer.
* AWS are responsible for "Security OF the Cloud"
  * AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud
  * This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services
* Customers are responsible for "Security IN the Cloud"
  * For EC2 this includes network level security (NACLs, security groups), operating system patches and updates, IAM user access managemnet, and client and server-side data encrpytion
* Inherited Controls - Customers fully inherits from AWS
  * Physical and Environmental controls
* Shared Controls - Controls which apply to both the infrastrucutre layer and customer layers, but in completely separate contexts of perspectives
  * Patch Management - AWS is responsible for patching the fixing flaws within the infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest OS and applications
  * Configuration Management - AWS maintains the configuration of its' infrastructure devices, but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, databases, and applications
  * Awareness & Training - AWS trains AWS employees, but a customer must train their own employees
* Customer Specific - Controls which are solely the responsibility of the customer based on the application they are deploying within AWS services.  Examples include:
  * Service and Communications Protection or Zone Security which may require a customer to route or zone dat within specific security environments

Examples of Customer Responsibility:
* Staff training
* Bucket with objects
* Data encryption
* IAM Role
* IAM User
* MFA
* Network ACL
* Security Group
* SSL encrpytion
